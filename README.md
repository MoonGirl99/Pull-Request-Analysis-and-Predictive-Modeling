# Pull-Request-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling

This project involves researching two main questions related to pull requests on Github: 

1) the reasons for changes in pull requests
2) whether a pull request will be merged.

The tasks include selecting projects, querying pull requests via the Github API, conducting qualitative analysis, building a predictive model, and presenting results. 

To do this project it will be needed to use Python and various data analysis tools to collect and analyze data to answer the research questions.

The procedure of project: 
1) Extracting
2) Labeling
3) Calculating Kappa
4) Statistical test on data
5) Working On Models


The algorithms that have been used for this project are: Random Forest Classifer and K Nearest Neighbors 

The statistical test is: Fleiss Kappa

Packages that are used in this project are:
1) [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2) [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
3) [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
4) [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
5) [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
6) [github](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
is useful for extracting phase.
